## Project Is
Hack your future graduation project

## Introduction to the idea
While the increased number of refugees comming to Europe, I have noticed around me and in many of social media pages that most of them have difficulties in choosing the food products because they are used to eat what is called **"Halal Food"**, and I am one of those people who stand for long time reading the ingredients of each product before buying it, mostly meat, sweets and chips who have **E-number** materials in its contents, So why don't we create an easy useful way to help people in this issue!

*notice: Halal is an Arabic word that means "permissible." In terms of food, it means food that is permissible according to Islamic law. For a meat to be certified "halal," it cannot be dead by itself  or from pork.* 

## Project Idea
Food ingredients detector if Halal or not.

## Functional Requirments
1. R1: ***Display data of some food with status*** 

2. R2: ***Input place for code testing by the user***
where the user has to write the E-code number of his product in a text box and press enter to see the result which contains"status, name and other details.
3. R3: ***Show Halal stores nearby depending on user location***
it will be by load, when the webpage is loaded it will find the user location and show him where there are halal stores near by his location.
4. R4: ***(extra) Adding stores by user-approved by page admin***
any visitor can add new store by his own and fill a form, and then webpage admin has to login and approve these addition if they are as well.
